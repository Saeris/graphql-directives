## üöß Under Construction

> Warning: This library is still under construction! This message will be removed once it's published and available for use!

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install --save graphql @saeris/graphql-directives
# or
yarn add graphql @saeris/graphql-directives
```

## üîß Usage

To use these directives add them to your Schema Directives when you initialize your Apollo Server:

```js
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server"
import CustomDirectives from "@saeris/graphql-directives"
import typeDefs from "./types"
import resolvers from "./resolvers"
// Alternatively, import individual directives:
// import { formatDate } from "@saeris/graphql-directives"

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schemaDirectives: {
    // formatDate
    ...CustomDirectives
  }
})

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`üöÄ Server ready at ${url}`)
})
```

Now you can use them in your schema just like you would any other Directive:

```graphql
type Person {
  # ...
  birthDate: String @formatDate(default: "MMMM D, YYYY")
  # ...
}
```

## üèñÔ∏è Example

You can quickly take this library for a spin by running the example either locally under the `example` directory (just run `yarn && yarn start` and open your browser to http://localhost:4000) or live inside of CodeSandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Saeris/graphql-directives/).

## üó∫ Directives

### formatDate

```js
import { formatDate } from "@saeris/graphql-directives"
```

Allows clients to apply custom date formatting to date strings. Uses [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/v1.30.1/docs/format) under the hood. Formats include the following:
